✅ What is OCI and why do people want it?
1. Helm charts normally live on a “Helm Repository”

This is the old-school approach:

A Helm repo is basically:

an HTTP server

hosting a index.yaml

and a couple of .tgz chart files

Example:

https://opensearch.org/charts/index.yaml


Helm client pulls:

helm repo add opensearch https://opensearch.org/charts
helm install opensearch/opensearch-operator
